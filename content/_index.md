A very warm welcome to those who are new to our school community, we hope that our website and social media provides you with a window into our school, but if you can’t find what you are looking for, please don’t hesitate to get in touch using the contact details at the bottom of this page. We hope that you will sense and experience the warmth of our ‘Joey’ family as we seek to serve each other and build God’s Kingdom here on earth.
