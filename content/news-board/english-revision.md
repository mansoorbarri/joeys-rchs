Dear Parent/Carer,
                                      
At this crucial time in the studies of Year 11 students, it is essential all students are given as many opportunities as possible to advance and develop skills essential for academic success. It is with the aim of ensuring every student reaches their full potential that English staff will be providing extra revision sessions for students on two consecutive Sundays next half term. This is to prepare them for the English Language examinations scheduled in June.

The revision sessions will be held on Sunday 4th June and Sunday 11th June, running between 10am and 12noon. Students will need to travel safely to and from school on the day of each session. We ask parents/carers to ensure their child can do this safely. Students will need to sign-in at Main Reception upon arrival and sign out on exit. There will be no access to refreshments, but students are welcome to bring a bottle of water and a suitable snack if they wish. 

The following staff will be holding revision sessions for their classes:

| Sunday 4th June | Sunday 11th June |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Mrs C Wood – 11Rowling | Mrs C Wood – 11Rowling |
| Miss C Malone – 11Green | Miss C Malone – 11Green |
| Mrs H Howe – 11Wilde | Mrs H Howe – 11Wilde |
| Mr Minns – 11Austen | Mrs L Knox – 11Joyce |
| Miss Cross – 11Eliot | Miss Cross – 11Eliot |
| Miss Morton – 11Lee | Miss Morton – 11Lee |


Please not all staff are available on both days. Staff who are unable to host a revision session on one or both of these days will ensure revision material is available to their students on Microsoft Teams. Students are also encouraged to see their teacher if they require hard copies of sample papers or other material.

We would really like students to benefit from these sessions and so we politely request parents and carers to encourage children to attend. To provide your permission for your child to attend, please complete the slip below and return to your child’s teacher by Friday 26th May. Please also indicate which sessions your child will be attending so we are aware of how many children will be on site for these sessions.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at school.

**Mrs C Wood** | Head of English
