Dear Parents and Carers,

Like many high schools at present, we are experiencing some unwanted behaviours from our young people.   We know that students feel safe when there are clear boundaries; so we would like to take this opportunity to explain some of the ways we will be tightening up our procedures to make acceptable standards clearer to young people. These will be explained to students by form tutors this morning and in special assemblies on Friday.  Whilst the majority of students are extremely well behaved there are others that might encourage them to test the boundaries. Parenting in the current age is harder than ever before so we want you to know that we are here to help in any way we can.  We know that when parents, carers and school work together the child is more likely to make sensible choices. We share our stance to support each child to be the best versions of themselves.

### Uniform
Wearing uniform incorrectly is a sign of defiance. From tomorrow, there will be a focus on ensuring that there are: 
- No piercings, false eye lashes or false nails
- Skirts are to be worn to the right length
- No trainers (the definition of a shoe is that it must be polishable and be plain black with no visible logos – see below) 
- Black not white socks
- No Jewellery 
- No hodies* - *Please note that all hoodies and Shackets (Except the school leavers’ hoodie) are banned even if they have a zip down the front.  If it is not designed as an outside garment and fits over the blazer it will not be allowed and will be confiscated.  
- Ties worn at all times
- Coats not worn in lessons. To be clear, these are the acceptable combinations: 
- Coat and blazer if cold (outside coat to be removed in classrooms) 
- Blazer without coat
- If a student is too warm they ask and will be granted permission to remove their blazer in a classroom.
- Students should have a bag and carry basic equipment for the day basics - pen, pencil, purple pen, ruler and eraser as well as their PE kit when needed.  

Incorrect items will be confiscated on arrival at school and can be picked up at the end of the day.  If there is a repeat we ask that parents/carers come in to pick up offending items. Students will lose their lunchtimes if they choose to wear incorrect items during the school day. 

### Mobile Phones
We need to protect students from the fear that others may use their phone to record them.  We also need to avoid students using their phone to call a parent/carer whenever they are held to account for a wrong choice.  As you can imagine this undermining of the school’s behaviour policy, compromises school and confuses the child.  Our experience is that when this happens the child is more likely to push boundaries that exclude them from our community.  If phones are used around school your child will be taken off the yard immediately, the phone confiscated and they will miss their lunch break. **If mobile phones are used in lessons these will be confiscated and an afterschool detention will be issued. If a mobile is confiscated more than once a parent/carer will be called to pick up the phone from school.**

### Vapes
Due to two episodes where students were rushed to hospital we have a zero tolerance towards vapes.  Over £30,000 worth of counterfeit vapes were removed from local stores by trading standards.  Our new vape sensors have detected THC. Parents have told us that they believed that these were bought from ‘reputable’ stores.  The increase in the number of children using toilets during lessons is indicative that some of our young people are dangerously addicted to these vapes.  There is a reason the Australian government have made vapes legal only on prescription. We believe that there is a direct correlation between vapes and the erratic behaviour displayed by some of our young people.  In short, there are great risks attached to vaping so please do not turn a blind eye.  If a child is caught vaping they will receive a detention and the offer of addiction support. The second time could result in a suspension. 

### Time out passes
We will be reviewing all time out passes and re-issuing every half term to reduce the number of time out passes.  Time out allows a young person to stand outside a room for a maximum of three minutes.  It doesn’t allow them to wander round school. Where necessary, if a child needs adult attention, the teacher will request on-call to take the child to a safe space with a trusted adult.  Any abuse of a time out pass will result in the pass being removed. 

### Toilets
Toilets should only be used at break times.  In absolute emergencies a young person may need to use them during lesson time.  If this happens, the young person will be expected to make up for the time missed from lessons at the following break time. This will help them work out if they really need to go. If your child has medical advice, they can be issued a temporary toilet pass on receipt of evidence from a medical professional.  If you have medical evidence that your child needs a temporary toilet pass please alert your HoY so that this can be in place after half term. With Y11 departing shortly after half term there should be plenty of time to use the facilities at break times.  In September we will be opening a brand new toilet resource in addition to the facilities that we already have. 

### Punctuality 
There are few jobs where punctuality is not required.  To train young people for the world of work any student who is late for the day or for lessons will lose part of their break time or be detained after school.  

### Litter
We believe that we have a duty to teach children to dispose of their own litter in the bins provided.  It is quite hard to enforce this outside.  Therefore, students will not be able to take any food packaging outside of the canteen or away from the canopy near the pod.  This way we can supervise them disposing of their litter. We also ask all to note that chewing gum is banned from site.  This is to prevent it from being disposed of irresponsibly. 

### Refusal 
If your child refuses to comply with what we are asking, we will call you to ask for your support in explaining that to be part of the school family means following our values.  We understand that some young people make mistakes and we desire to help them by correcting them in a supportive loving environment. We ask that students speak to staff respectfully at all times and as such we expect them to refrain from using foul language.

### Trauma or SEND needs  
We are aware that some students may have special needs either learning needs or due to adverse childhood experiences.  We know that the research shows that these children need very clear boundaries but that they may sometimes need a slightly different approach.  Please don’t confuse this as a lack of consistency.  We expect a consistency of standard but we understand that some may need support to do this. 

### Restorative practice
Where possible we wish for consequences to be restorative and for the sanction to help the young person to realise how they have wronged the community.  This way they are more likely to learn from the occasion and get it right in future.  

The contents of this letter will be shared by form tutors on Wednesday and followed up with an assembly on Friday.  Please talk to your child about the need to tighten up standards and share their responsibility for doing this. On Thursday and Friday we will confiscate items that are not allowed and warn students about the consequences they will face after half term if the behaviour persists. 

In this Sunday’s Gospel from John 17, we heard how on Jesus’ final night he prayed that his people would be ‘one’ and that they would be kept safe from evil. Our prayer is the same for our community that we may be one.  

_“I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one, I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.”_

If you wish to seek clarification about any part of this letter as always please contact your child’s form tutor or head of year so that they can talk you through why each of these things is important for the safe running of our school.
Many thanks for your continued support

**Mr T McCabe**
