This may be the LAST Get into Veterinary Medicine conference of this academic year, so I recommend that any students considering veterinary medicine secure their place as soon as possible. Any students that have attended before are encouraged to attend again for a recap.

Dr James and Dr Shannon will cover:

- Application Timelines
- How to Tactically Choose Veterinary Schools
- CV Building
- Personal Statements
- Interview Skills
- Leadership and Awards Programmes
- Accessing Work Experience
- Accessing Scholarships to study Veterinary Medicine at university
