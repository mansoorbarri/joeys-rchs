St. Joseph’s  is an 11-16 voluntary aided co-educational Roman Catholic Secondary School under the trusteeship of The Diocese of Salford.  We are maintained by the Bolton Local Authority and have 860 students enrolled.  St. Joseph’s was established as a secondary school on 5th November 1963.

The school has a long-standing reputation for **high academic achievement**, being an orderly, caring and **welcoming community** and provision for an extensive range of extra-curricular and out of hours activities.

St Joseph’s serves Catholic chidren who live in five nominated parishes and who receive their primary education in one of six associated primary schools.  They are **St. Mary’s** (Horwich), **Sacred Heart** (Westhoughton), **Our Lady’s** (Aspull), **Holy Family** (New Springs), **St. Joseph’s** (Anderton) and **St. Bernard’s** (Ladybridge).

This allowed the school to expand on the amount of sporting opportunities provided to our students.    The school has many students attending from well outside the school’s catchment area.  Students start at the school with a wide range of education achievement and social backgrounds, broadly in line with the national average distribution.  A very small proportion of students are from minority ethnic groups; there are an extremely small number for whom English is a second language.  The proportion of students in the school identified as having special and additional educational needs, including students with a statement of special educational needs is broadly in line with the national average.   The proportion of students known to be eligible for free school meals is below the national average.

The school’s links with the local community are outstanding and recognised in the last Ofsted Inspection for the quality of its community links.  The school aims to ensure that it is at the heart of the community and that the community is at the heart of the school.  Students are offered a curriculum, which used the community as a resource to enrich teaching and learning, with individuals and groups involved in the school, complementing and enhancing the knowledge and expertise of the teaching staff.

The Governing Body is responsible for admissions and all decisions are made in accordance with the Schools Admissions Policy.  St Joseph’s offers every child the benefit of a varied curriculum and an environment in which the students feel that they are known, valued and cared for.  In order to deliver the highest standard of education to all we consider our relationship with our partner primary schools to be of vital importance, and there is an extensive programme of liaison each year.

There is an effective pastoral system that helps children settle quickly into the school and ensures that they are well cared for throughout their time as students of St Joseph’s.

##### “St Joseph’s is an outstanding Catholic school… all members of the school community recognise the way in which the headteacher leads by example in ensuring that its Mission Statement becomes a reality of its everyday lift, ably supported by leaders at all levels including the senior pupils.” *(Diocese of Salford Section 48 Inspection – April 2010)*
