### Alumni
New and exciting adventure:
If you’re a former student of St Joseph’s RC High School, we want to hear from you!
 
Lifelong friendships and treasured memories are formed at St Joseph’s.  Skills and abilities are mastered to aid students in the future.
 
If you think you can help transform our students confidence, motivation, skills and inspire a future generation we want to hear from you…
 
St Joseph’s Careers have partnered up with St Joseph’s Facebook to create an amazing opportunity for former students to keep in touch with us, to offer inspiration to our current students, offer specialised knowledge and stay connected with other former students.
 
Please email Mrs Hancock or Mrs Flanagan for further information: alumni@st-josephs.bolton.sch.uk
