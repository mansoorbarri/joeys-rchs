Religious Education is a core subject at St Joseph’s. The RE Department strives to promote the best possible teaching and learning of curriculum Religious Education. Pupils receive five one hour lessons of Religious Education over a two week period. The curriculum is broad and inclusive where all pupils follow the Religious Education Curriculum Directory for Catholic Schools and Colleges in England and Wales 2012.Topics of study range from Judaism and the early Christian Church to whether God exists and why is there so much suffering. Pupils learn using interactive methods and are challenged to think deeply about the ‘big questions of life’. They develop their understanding of the bible and are encouraged to accurately use comprehensive religious language in their work. This means that they leave St Joseph’s confident in their own religious beliefs and practices.  A high standard of work is expected. The pupils’ progress throughout the year will be assessed on classwork, homework, oral contribution, assessment tasks and an end of unit assessment. A variety of teaching and learning styles are used to encourage pupils to think deeply and participate fully in lessons. Homework is set once a week and may take the form of a GCSE style exam question, research or a creative task.

Pupils enjoy RE. “The curriculum RE provided for pupils in St Joseph’s contributes in no small way to their outstanding academic achievement and spiritual and moral development.” (Section 48, Ofsted Inspection 2010).

RE gives me the opportunity to develop skills I may need when I leave school, those that help me to be more tolerant and accepting of others. Pupil Voice – Year 10

RE allows me to think about big questions and what I believe. Pupil Voice – Year 9
