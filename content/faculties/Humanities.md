We have a structured assessment procedure to ensure all pupils make the maximum progress. Pupils are assessed at 5 (6 in Y11) stages with a combination of modular and linear tests and tasks. This information is sent home to parents so they can also be an integral part of the process.

We have a Curriculum Area Leader for Humanities who is supported by a team of 5 Teaching Staff, each with specialism in either History or Geography.  The faculty is based on the upper and lower floors of the western wing of the main corridor.

### Geography: 
Geography doesn’t simply begin and end with maps showing the location of all the countries of the world.  Geography poses fascinating questions about who we are and how we got to be that way.

Geography is the mother lode of sciences.  It’s the hub of a circle from which other sciences and studies radiate: meteorology and climatology, ecology, geology, oceanography, demographics, cartography, agricultural studies, economics, political science. At some level, all these can be related back to geographic factors. It is a solid understanding of geography that is a vital, basic ingredient for a rounded, full understanding of the world and our place in it.

Geography at St. Joseph’s is a dynamic, engaging and relevant subject and we believe that our students have access to a modern curriculum that develops a wide range of transferrable skills. Geography creates a sense of wonder about places and allows students to solve problems on current issues.  Our students can collect, record and analyse information, work independently or as part of a team and they can justify conclusions.

We believe that Geography fully incorporates the key strands of the school mission statement, supported by an effective use of ICT and stimulating field trips which engage our students and allow them to achieve their full potential.

### History:
We are committed to delivering high quality, challenging, interesting and appropriate learning experiences to all our students, inside and outside of the classroom. History is a popular subject at St. Joseph’s and we work hard to provide our students with the tools to be successful not only in History but in other areas by providing skills that will be useful in the future.  We believe History is a vital part of education. People have a natural inquisitiveness about their past and we want to develop that with fun and interesting lessons that appeal to students of all backgrounds.

The curriculum we offer allows students to understand and value the cultures and heritages of other people, giving them particular skills that are not developed elsewhere – like chronology, or interpretations of the past through the presentation of sources and historical artifacts.  We believe that by studying political, economic, social and cultural developments in line with the Catholic church, that it prepares our students to be citizens of the modern world enriched in the faith and belief of Christianity.
