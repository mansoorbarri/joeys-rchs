Our school library is located in our Learning Resource Centre, on first floor of the Brian Brady Centre.  We believe in providing the resources to our students which will aid study and complement individual subjects through the use of traditional literature and modern technology.

The Library contains over 3000 Fiction titles, categorised into an A-Z system using the Author’s surname and our display units are changed regularly to keep the latest and fresh new titles on show, ready to loan out.  There are also just over 2000 Non-Fiction titles, poetry, plays and graphic novels.  We have a vast selection of career resources, ranging from Further Education literature to specially created materials from Connexions.  We also have a selection of magazines and newspapers, including our monthly subscription to First News.

Our books are also colour coded to support our Accelerated Reading programme, which ensures the books students choose suit or challenge their abilities.

Part of the LRC incorporates the Media Suite, ICT3.  We operate a policy that students need to have written consent from a teacher in order to use the computer suite during lunch hours.

To further support our students in years 7, 8 and 9, they can now access our online reading resource, MyOn, both in school and from home using MyOn.co.uk and their unique log in.

You may, however, use the Library and Private Study area on your allocated day as shown below:

| Time               | Activity                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday lunchtime   | Year 7 - Library time to take out/renew library books |
| Tuesday lunchtime  | Year 8 and 9 – Library time to take out/renew library books |
| Wednesday lunchtime | Year 10 and 11 – Library time to take out/renew library books |
| Thursday lunchtime | Knitting club |
| Friday lunchtime (week A) | Year 9 reading intervention |
| Friday lunchtime (week B) | Closed at the moment – this is subject to change. |

We are proud of the team of staff who manage and co-ordinate the Library.  Their work is complemented by a team of students as well as specialist staff in other areas.
