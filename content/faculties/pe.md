Qualifications are offered up to GCSE Level in Physical Education and Sports Science.  **All students participate in compulsory Physical Education, which does not give a GCSE but supports our ethos that every member of our community has access to facilities and teaching to maintain a healthy lifestyle.**

We have a **Curriculum Area Leader for Physical Education** who is supported by a team of **3 Teaching Staff.**  The faculty is based in the Sports Building.

The aim of the PE department is to have an impact on students’ lives in terms of their personal development, well-being and achievement both academically and in other non-academic areas. By increasing opportunities for physical activity and educating about healthier lifestyles, our aims for our students is to improve their overall health; introduce opportunities for social interaction; give opportunities for improved social and moral developments; reduce the risk of developing adult diseases; achieving a sense of well being and self-esteem; reducing the likelihood of anxiety and stress; maintenance of energy balance and an improved cognitive function for academic achievement in school.

Research has shown that if students lead healthier lifestyles, including physical activity, then they are more likely to achieve their full academic potential.

**Shepherd** (1997) found that academic performance was maintained or even enhanced by an increase in Physical Activity. When curricular time was allocated to physical activity, learning proceeded more rapidly per unit of classroom time. Academic development was not compromised by an increase in time spent on Physical Education. Improved numeracy and literacy skills have been reported in the latest independent review of the Government initiative ‘Playing for Success’. Successful Physical Education and school sports contribute to higher levels of participation and achievement, higher levels of attainment and relaxed and focused children and young people.
