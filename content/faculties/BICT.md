Curriculum content is taught from Year 7 upwards and individual pathways can be opted for, depending on individual strengths and interests from Year 9 onwards.  

Throughout Years 7 and 8 the content is broad and well balanced to ensure that all students receive a well-rounded education within this area, fully meeting the requirements of the National Curriculum and ensuring that they well equipped for the future and have a good level of digital literacy.  Students knowledge and skills are well supported with homework to ensure that all students achieve the iDEA Bronze Award (and many achieving Silver).  The iDEA Awards (also known as the Duke of York Awards) are nationally recognised and are known to be the digital literacy equivalency of the Duke of Edinburgh award. (https://idea.org.uk)

During the options process students are made aware of which pathways would most reflect the content covered with Years 7 and 8,  This ensures that all students are aware of the typical content covered within Years 9, 10 and 11 and so that judgements and decisions are fully informed.  The road maps of content, skills and understanding build upon that covered during the first two years at St Joseph’s.

The options currently offered by the department are detailed below:

OCR Cambridge Nationals Level 1/2 Creative iMedia – this course covers everything related to the creative elements of IT.  Students will study various units of work covering a variety of digital products for example: photo editing, video editing, interactive multimedia products, comic strip creation, sound editing.
