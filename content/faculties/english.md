Studies in English are extremely important because the essential skills learned in our subject not only underpin work in most other areas of the school curriculum, but will also continue to be important throughout life. Learning and teaching in English aims to prepare students for lifelong learning and success in the world of work. Essential skills are developed across a 5-year curriculum to enable all students to flourish in to high-achieving individuals who can face the challenges of the evolving workplace of the 21st Century. Students are provided with opportunities to undertake independent studies and communicate in a range of mediums to showcase their resilience and adaptability.

English also develops a sense of curiosity and excitement with the world of reading. It builds and sharpens critical thinking skills; refines students’ understanding and appreciation for diverse reading experiences; as well as shows students how reading can improve mental health, unleash creativity and be a source of comfort in our lives. English stretches our creative talents as imaginative writers developing a confident grasp of language and technique. Students are encouraged to apply their understanding of linguistic crafting to their own writing to demonstrate they too can be masters of language.

### SMSC in English

Learning in English provides a fantastic opportunity for students to explore the many conflicting issues evident in society in a safe and nurturing environment. English teaching promotes the importance of mutual respect and empathy so students can understand how and why conflicts arise, learning how to respect the differing views of others, empathising with perspectives and situations different to their own. Students are encouraged to explore philosophical ideas and are challenged to explore all avenues to widen their understanding of the diverse world around them. Teaching aims to remove the stigma surrounding the discussion of sometimes controversial topics allowing students to develop a deeper understanding of the world around them. From mental health issues to racial injustice, hypocrisy and corruption to gender discrimination, students’ moral development is an integral part of their English studies to ensure they not understand the big ideas presented in the texts they study, but so they are also equipped with the necessary moral skills for life in the ever-evolving wider world.
