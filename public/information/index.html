<p>St Joseph’s RC High School prioritizes the physical and mental wellbeing of all its pupils. Mental health provision is universally provided for all pupils through ‘wellbeing Friday’ during tutor time. The school aims to create a learning environment that promotes resilience and where pupils feel safe and supported.</p>
<p>The school provides safeguarding support for the whole community, working closely with Bolton Council and other relevant organizations. The Designated Safeguarding Lead is Mr Singleton, and the Deputy DSLs are Mrs Anderton, Mr Sylvester, and Miss Warwick.</p>
<p>The school also participates in Encompass, a partnership between Greater Manchester Police, Bolton Safeguarding Children Board, and designated school staff. This partnership aims to safeguard children by informing Key Adults within schools about any domestic abuse incident where the child or young person has been present. Key adults within the school are then able to accommodate the school day to lessen the impact and support the child if they need it.</p>
