		<p>Whether you are looking for information about our school or arrived here by chance, you are very welcome. We hope that you can sense the warm family values of our school. At St Joseph’s we are committed to safeguarding and keeping our young people safe and happy.</p>
<p>A very warm welcome to those who are new to our school community, we hope that our website and social media provides you with a window into our school, but if you can’t find what you are looking for, please don’t hesitate to get in touch using the contact details at the bottom of this page. We hope that you will sense and experience the warmth of our ‘Joey’ family as we seek to serve each other and build God’s Kingdom here on earth.</p>

<h3 id="mr-bill-charnley-rip">Mr Bill Charnley RIP</h3>
<p>Those who knew Bill will be deeply saddened by the loss and those who never met him will, I am sure have heard of his work.  The comments on our recent Facebook post bears witness to the many lives that Bill saved in his work.    Bill was a strong rock in the Horwich community for well over 40 years supporting local children at school but also in the wider community. For over 25 years, Bill volunteered his services as a counsellor to the school and as a result, generations of pupils have been supported during some of the most turbulent and distressing times of their lives. We are delighted that Bill Was awarded a Benemernti medal and recognised by Pearson as an unsung hero.</p>
<p>Bill’s desire to better the life chances of young people is immeasurable.  We are honoured that the Charnley Building at St Joseph’s serves as a lasting reminder of Bill’s work so that people will drive past in years to come and say “It was here that I found joy in life and discovered who God had called me to be.”</p>
<p>Bill Charnley, Rest in Peace.</p>
<h4 id="eternal-rest-grant-unto-him-o-lord-and-let-perpetual-light-shine-upon-him-may-he-rest-in-peace-amen">Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. Amen.</h4>
